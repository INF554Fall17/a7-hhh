# INF 554 Assignment 7

## Description 
Create a presentation with [Sozi](http://sozi.baierouge.fr) to pitch your project to the class. Pitch the projects using the [PechaKucha](http://www.pechakucha.org) presentation format. PechaKucha is a simple presentation format where you show 20 images, each for 20 seconds. The images advance automatically and you talk along with the images. You cannot use bullets in any of your slides. On the first slide, include the project title, your group, and your names. Export your presentation as `a7-groupname.pdf` and add it to the repository.

__What to include in your project pitch?__

- Speak simply (use simple words and simple sentence construct)
- Lead with 10 words on why you chose this project
- Why is your project interesting?
- Who is the audience?
- Why is your visualization important?
- How is your visualization useful?
- What are you telling with your visualization? What is the story?
- How do you plan to use interactive visuals?
- What are your design considerations?
- What are the components that make your visualization cool?
- How does your visualization compare to what others have done?
- What are the technologies you plan to use?
- How are you going to design, build, and evaluate?
- What are your deliverables?
- How do you work together?
- What is your timeline?

__GIT good practice__

To demonstrate good practice of GIT, do **not** commit your files to GIT after you are done with the whole presentation. Commit in a small chunk of work. For example, start with an outline and then commit, work on a few slides and then commit, make some changes and then commit.
